## Installation with Docker

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lucchesilorenzo/quickbite
   cd quickbite
   code .
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install && npm run install-all
   ```

3. **Configure frontend environment variables**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

   Create a `.env` file at the root of the frontend project and copy what's in the `.env.example` file:

   ```bash
   VITE_APP_NAME="Order food from your favorite local restaurants | QuickBite"
   VITE_APP_DESCRIPTION="QuickBite lets you order food online from your favorite local restaurants with fast delivery and no hassle."
   VITE_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"
   VITE_LOCATIONIQ_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

4. **Configure backend environment variables**:

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   ```

   Create a `.env` file at the root of the backend project and copy what's in the `.env.example` file. Then, configure your database connection details:

   ```bash
   DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
   DB_HOST=db
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_DATABASE=quickbite
   DB_USERNAME=quickbite
   DB_PASSWORD=quickbite
   ```

5. **Generate the Laravel application key by running:**

   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Start the containers with:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

7. **Make migrations and seed data:**

   ```bash
   docker compose exec api php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

8. **Create symlink for public folder**:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec api php artisan storage:link
   ```

   If you've already created the symlink in the host machine, we first need to remove it and then create a new one:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec api rm public/storage && docker compose exec api php artisan storage:link
   ```

9. **Access the frontend at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).**
